# Crosshair-Overlay
A movable overlay for a custom crosshair. Intended to be used over windowed or borderless window games which provide either non-existant or unsuitable crosshairs.

## Usage
The crosshair will be displayed over the game and can be repositioned by focusing on the crosshair application via the taskbar and holding CTRL + W, A, S or D.
It can  then be recentralised if you wish with CTRL + C key
The crosshair can be changed to another image with a .png efile extension, if you're getting tired of the default crosshair, with CTRL + F and selecting a new image from your file system.
If you decide you want the default crosshair back, simply restart the application or or use CTRL + R.

A demonstration of the crosshair overlay can be found below
